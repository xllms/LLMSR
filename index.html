                            LLM-SR aims to generate a controllable and interpretable reasoning process by employing step-by-step inferences. In this task, we focus on a fine-grained analysis of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process, which enables a more detailed evaluation of LLMs and contributes to Process Reward Modeling, thereby enhancing the generation of more coherent and accurate reasoning processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To achieve this, the task requires generating "question_parsing" and "cot_parsing" results based on the content of "question" and "cot" (produced by Llama-3-8B-Instruct) for each given question. The question parsing process involves extracting all conditions necessary for solving the question. The CoT parsing process identifies all "statements" and their corresponding "evidence" within the context of the question conditions and the given CoT content. Subsequently, for each extracted statement-evidence pair, a conclusion is required to determine whether the evidence sufficiently supports the statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Focusing on the LLM’s capacity for fine-grained question analysis and deduction based on given conditions, we provide only 24 training examples to illustrate the data format and question types. Furthermore, participants can only use the Llama-3-8B-Instruct as their backbone model.

                            This task consists of two parts: <b style="color: red;">Question parsing</b> and <b style="color: red;">CoT parsing</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Question parsing involves extracting all relevant conditions required to solve the problem. The Macro F1 score metric is used to evaluate question parsing performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The process of extracting statements and evidence is similar to Discourse Parsing. Correct extraction of statements or evidence from the COT is crucial at the outset. Next, the pairwise relationship between a specific statement and its corresponding evidence is assessed (a statement should be followed by its related evidence from the COT). Both semantic and lexical similarity are used to evaluate the accuracy of statements and evidence predictions. The final evaluation metric is the Macro F1 score, applied to both statement parsing and statement-evidence pair extraction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, once a statement-evidence pair is correctly extracted, it is evaluated to determine whether the evidence can logically deduce the statement. The Macro F1 score metric is again used for this evaluation.

                            Our challenge seeks to investigate the structure reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in low-resource settings. To this end, we introduce a fine-grained Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis dataset derived from LogiQA, comprising 24 annotated examples that constitute the training set. Each example is supplemented with question parsing and CoT parsing annotations.
